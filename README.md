# Titanic-Portfolio-Project

The challenge
The competition is simple: we want you to use the Titanic passenger data (name, age, price of ticket, etc) to try to predict who will survive and who will die.

The data
To take a look at the competition data, click on the Data tab at the top of the competition page. Then, scroll down to find the list of files.
There are three files in the data: (1) train.csv, (2) test.csv, and (3) gender_submission.csv.
